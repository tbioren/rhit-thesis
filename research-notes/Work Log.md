### Week 1 Summary

- I created this Obsidian Notebook and git repo.
- I organized times to meet with Eduardo.
- I began reading my first paper and established expectations for the quarter.
### Week 2 Summary

- Modified the burnup chart so it's embedded in this work log note instead of in a separate Excel sheet.
- I read the slides and watched the accompanying YouTube video for [[Julian Miller - Tutorial CGP]].
- I decided to focus on designing the experiment for a [[Pico-Ice]] FPGA board because it's similar to EHW and hopefully will be easy to cross-reference bitstream performance in the future.
