## What It Is

Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) is a way of representing a program structure as a digraph. Each node represents an operation (I think that's called a phenotype **CONFIRM**). ![[CGP_Example.png]]

## Ways to Implement

- [hal-cgp](https://github.com/Happy-Algorithms-League/hal-cgp]) seems like it's a well-supported CGP python repository.
- [CGP-Library](https://github.com/AndrewJamesTurner/CGP-Library) is for C.
